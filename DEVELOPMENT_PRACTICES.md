# Development Practices

*   **Run Unit Tests:** Run unit tests (`pytest -v`) and ensure they pass before *every* commit. Fix any failures before proceeding.
*   **Add Unit Tests:** Always add unit tests for new functionality.
*   **Script Permissions:** Ensure any new shell scripts (`.sh`) are made executable (`chmod +x <script_name>.sh`).
